This project implements a REST service in Spring Boot to validate digital signatures in PDF documents. It is capable of processing signatures from different Ecuadorian certification entities such as Security Data, UANATACA, among others.

## üéâ Features

- Validation of digital signatures in PDF documents
- Extraction of signer information:
  - Full name
  - ID number
  - Certification entity
  - Date of signature
  - Certificate validity status
- Support for multiple signatures in a single document
- Support for different Ecuadorian certification entities

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack

- **[Java](https://www.java.com/)** - Programming language
- **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)** - Framework for creating web applications
- **[PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/)** - Library for working with PDF documents
- **[Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/)** - Cryptography library
- **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)** - Dependency management
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - Containerization platform

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geo-mena/signsafe.git
cd signsafe
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

3. Run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Or run the application directly:

```bash
java -jar target/validador-firmas-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

The REST service exposes a single endpoint to validate digital signatures in PDF documents:

```plaintext
POST /api/validador/verificar
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

The PDF file must be sent as a multipart form with the name `file`. The service will respond with a JSON containing the information of the digital signatures found in the document.

## üìÑ Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Se encontraron 1 firma(s) en el documento",
  "data": [
    {
      "nombreCompleto": "JUAN PEREZ",
      "cedula": "1234567890",
      "entidadCertificadora": "SECURITY DATA S.A. 2",
      "fechaFirma": "2024-11-26T02:02:44.000+00:00",
      "esValida": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîíÔ∏è Validation Features

The service performs the following validations:

- Extraction of digital certificate data
- Verification of certificate validity
- Support for different digital signature formats
- Handling of multiple signatures in a document

## üö® Known Limitations

- Does not perform OCSP verification
- Does not verify revocation lists (CRL)
- Certificate chain validation is not implemented
